        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a student studying my first-year at the University of California, Riverside. Being a Pre-Business major, my short-term goal is to maintain a good GPA, get into the university‚Äôs school of business, and possibly even find an internship. From that point, I will look forward to finalizing which concentration I would like to go into.<br><br>

        I lived in Chino Hills for the majority of my life. Moving there from Buena Park at the age of two, I lived a pretty fair and simple life along with my mother, father, and older sister. My mother spends most of her time as a housemom, but she also enjoys making nursery rhymes for a Youtube Channel with over 70 million subscribers. My father is a Berkeley alumni who is currently a banker for CBB Bank. My sister, who is three years older than me, is attending her final quarter at UCSD studying psychology and education. She lives away from home and has a job working with children with learning disabilities.<br><br>

        Even though I am quite young, I feel like I have experienced and learned multiple things. Failing a numerous amount of times, I always bounced back and ended up succeeding. My first volunteer experience in high school was at the local dog shelter. At the shelter, my duties were to feed the dogs, clean the kennels, and take the dogs on walks. For something so simple I couldn‚Äôt have done anything more wrong. All I had to do was go at least once a week for about an hour, but I skipped out on many shifts and neglected my duties. After a couple months, I was dropped for my incompetence. Having a conviction, I decided to work hard for my next volunteer organization. I ended up volunteering at a korean christian organization called Milal where I would work with children with learning disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy, and down syndrome. After being assigned to a ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù, which is the term we referred to the children, I would work with the same buddy for the next six months every Saturday for around six to seven hours. My duties were to assist them in their daily activities and record their behaviors. Taking things way more seriously compared to the dog shelter, I volunteered with Milal until the end of my senior year in high school and received multiple Presidential Awards. A similar but quite different situation occurred when I was looking for a part-time job. After getting rejected from many restaurants for being a minor I finally got a chance to work as a busser at a restaurant called Show Sushi. After working a couple shifts, I found myself unable to keep up with the fast paced attention to detail that the restaurant required and the manager ended up letting me go after a month. Although I was unhappy with how the situation went, I was grateful for the training I received which helped me for my next job. The next job I found was at a chain restaurant called Slurpin‚Äô Ramen Bar. Although I was still quite slow at first, the training at Show was enough to not get me fired and eventually I became the person that would train new workers.
